# Blood Cell Image Classifier

This project is motivated by a free data set that I found online from the IEEE Biomedical Society, it contains very hard to distinguish image samples of cancer and healthy cells. In this project I hope to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify such images. I want to use both Google's Tensorflow API and the teachable machine website (MobileNet) for quick and easy deployment.

## Demo
[Python Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_OWkGEKsQ-966SutA3tQFFm2tUMgIHV-)

## Packages
- Tensorflow (TF) / TF Keras API
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- Google Cloud AI & ML


## Installation

```
pip install virtualenv

pip install tensorflow

virtualenv tf_leuk

env\scripts\activate
```

(current version of repo has no requirements.txt so ignore)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
